# :satellite:DevRadar

## Study app for the 10th Omnistack week from Rocketseat

The custom idea is to have a platform in which the user can search for developers around his local area by using technologies keywords, leading the user into the developer github profile. The integration was made using Github and Google Maps API.

This custom project will further lead into a personal project in the future. The personal project will be focused on the search for mental health professionals around the area of the user.
